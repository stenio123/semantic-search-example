# Semantic Search Example

## Overview

This example uses 1000 pdfs offered by the [US Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/2020445568/). The code will do the following:

### generateDataset.py

- Extracts the text from the pdfs
- Uses 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' to encode the vector representation
- Stores generated dataset as a local file

### uploadDatasetToHuggingFace.py

- Uploads a local file to a HuggingFace Dataset repository

### uploadToPinecone.py

- Retrieves a dataset from HuggingFace
- Transforms it to match Pinecone requirements
- Creates an index and upserts the dataset to Pinecone

### queryExample.py

- Given a query, fetches closely matching documents
- Generates a summary of the text to improve readability
